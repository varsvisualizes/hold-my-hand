# hold-my-hand
A physical computing project made for the library art show on February 14th, 2024, exhibited at the Hagen Ranch Road library. 

# Software & Hardware
## Raspberry Pi 3
I wanted to try using a Raspberry Pi for this project, so I booted up Raspbian with Processing included, then downloaded the Arduino 1.8.19 IDE ARM 32 bits. I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWCwJXz4B4I).
## Arduino Uno
I knew I wanted to have capacitive touch and LCD capability. While I could get the LCD attached the Raspberry Pi, I know for sure how to achieve this with Arduino. I'm also experienced with Arduino's Capacitive Sense library, which would come in handy (pun intended) when connecting to the copper wire hands.

# Materials
* Copper wire, formed to look like hands
* Jumper cables
* Alligator clips
* Raspberry Pi 3 + power supply
* Arduino Uno
* 2 breadboards
* Monitor, keyboard, and mouse for modifying the code on the Pi

# Outcome
To add a little visual interest, I made it appear as though a copper wire hand were emerging from a cardboard box, offering itself to the viewer.

I had planned to have the LCD screen inside the box, inviting the viewer to peek inside. After a few of the first exhibition visitors were unable to come to the conclusion to look inside the box, I simply placed the LCD right on top in their line of sight - the exposed wiring seemed to pique more interest, anyway.
